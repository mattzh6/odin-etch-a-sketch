# odin-etch-a-sketch

This project focuses on creating a simple etch-a-sketch application with just javascript, HTML, and CSS. The user is able to resize the grid by pressing on the resize grid button up to a maximum of 100x100 grid size. When hovering over a space, the square will turn into a random color.
